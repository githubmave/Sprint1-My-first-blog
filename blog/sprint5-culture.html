    <h1>Describe my role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming.</h1>
    
    <h3> August, 2020</h3><BR>
    
    
      <BLOCKQUOTE>        as a member of different groups, I have taken three different roles: vibe watcher, 
      git master, product owner. </BLOCKQUOTE> 
      
      <BLOCKQUOTE>In week4 group projects using React, we have perfect plan in the beginning.</BLOCKQUOTE>
    
      <BLOCKQUOTE>Bad luck came after dived deep into development.
      Sadly we found the impletementation was harder than we expected. The MVP funtion yet to show its clue even after lunch time. </br>

      <p>To avoid submitting a "blank paper", we "stole" a chunk of code from the open sources. We can present something to our cohorts, 
      but definitely resulted in lacking sense of self-fulfilment. </p>

      <p></p>Retrospectively, I can see where I was wrong viewing from the angle of a 
      vibe watcher, and a product owner.</p>
      
      <p>My vision of the project lacked of understanding react ‘s project tree, </p>
      
      <p>and how to make our user needs and wireframe to fit into this tree, number one. </p> 
      
      <p>Number two, timing is an another issue, so first thing must go first. </p>
      <p></p>Especially coming to the due time, it is important to decide what function is the 
      first priority , what can be given up. </p>
      
      <p>Nmber three,  as a vide watcher should have </p>
      triggered more interaction between each member, make sure every one has useful 
      things to do. </p>
      
      <p>Lastly, a vibe watch can play a big part in a group. I noticed that 
      people scare to let other members to know bugs were holding their process back.
       “Hi, Joe, how is going on your part? “ “ Hi, Jayden, what do you think of that?” 
       these sorts of communication would improve the team collaboration. 
       Help to achieve their learning objectives. </p>
